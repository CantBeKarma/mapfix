This is here so sampctl users can easily install this library and its
dependencies. If the original author wishes to host this library themselves,
please let me (Southclaws) know and I will transfer the repository.

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install sampctl/mapfix
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <mapfix>
```

## Usage

See the original thread for usage instructions.

## Testing

To test, simply run the package:

```bash
sampctl package run
```

And connect to `localhost:7777`.
